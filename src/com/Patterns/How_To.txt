How to approach :--


For eg:
            cols-->
     r       *
     o       * *
     w       * * *
     s       * * * *

no. of cols = 4
no. of rows = 4

(1) Run the outer loop for the no. of time you're having the lines.
    In the eg. no. of lines = no. of rows = no. of times the outer loop will run

(2) Identify, for every row no.,
    ->how many cols are there
    ->types of elements in the cols

(3) What do you need to print?!

**imp -- Try to find the formula relating rows and cols
